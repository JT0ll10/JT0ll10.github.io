    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by being focused and listening to the teacher because at the start of the lesson my GitHub was always showing up yellow not green. However by working with my teacher and a friend i managed to solve this and now my Github is working well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that there was only one teacher limited my learning because he could only work with one student at a time. However a friend helped me before the teacher came over. I need to work at being patient. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will work individually and listen to make sure i fulfill all tasks set by the teacher
