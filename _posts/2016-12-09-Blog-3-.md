    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had knowledge but none on how to create a table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To successfully create a table for my blogs. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Well if this is in a black table then yes I have succeeded.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I saw my teachers GitHub on the screen then copied it into mine so it looked the same. At first it was effective but then i realized my font and table were white so my writing wouldn't show up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that there was only one teacher limited my learning because he could only work with one student at a time. I need to work on copying the teacher. Also sometimes i missed important colons or semicolons meaning my website did not publish.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will work more individually and make sure to not always follow the teacher's example and change some bits for myself. This way i can work quickly and achieve the lesson girl quickly.


Bye this week!</td>
